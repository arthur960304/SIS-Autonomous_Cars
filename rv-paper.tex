\section{INTRODUCTION \& MOTIVATION}

Since we are entering the generation of industry 4.0, many factories are starting to change to automount way for logistics work. More and more factories are using automatic guided vehicle (AGV) system to help them transport objects from place to place. Moreover, AGV system is very efficient and cost-reducing.

Like factory, other places such as school, hospital and company also have same requirements for logistics. Workers in this place spend lots of time to exchange documents, deliver medical supplies and other stuffs. We expect that workers can save lots of time and effort in logistics work and focus more on their jobs if we implement AGV system in these places. 

However, current AGV system is designed for factory, which means they have huge size and could only navigate through limited routes which have less people walking around. Therefore it is not suitable for school, hospital and company which are complicated with lots of obstacles and human. 

To solve this problem, our team aims to develop a small AGV system which can be used in school or hospital to deliver stuffs. We design a small size autonomous car which can navigate through places to target location, avoid obstacles and human, recognize and grasp specific object, and communicate with other autonomous cars.

\begin{figure}[t]

\caption{We will first build one autonomous car. Our car can navigate through places and recognize objects. Next, we will build another two to three cars based on our first edition. At last, by exchanging information with others, our robots can be able to do some collaboration. For example in this figure, we aim to grasp a bigger object with collaboration between four cars.}

\subsection{SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE}

\begin{figure}[h]
\includegraphics[width=0.95\columnwidth]{system_architecture}

\caption{System architecture for automouns car system.}
\end{figure}

We build a mobile platform with microprocessor, controller, other sensors and is equipped with a manipulator. The gripper of manipulator should be stable enough to grasp reasonable weight. 

Microprocessor is the main part of the system, consider the price and ability, we use Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+ which install ROS on it as middleware to accept signals from other hardware such motor and sensors and give them command. Also we use Arduino UNO as controller to accept the command from Raspberry pi to control motors.

RPLiDAR is used to detect surrounding environment and send information to ROS for SLAM. RPi camera is used to capture the image which contain AprilTag and send back to ROS.

When autonomous cars are trying to collaborate, Wi-FI Module is used to exchange data with others to get location or other information. One of  autonomous cars will collects all data ,estimate the pose and send the pose information to the other autonomous cars.

\section{APPROACH}

\subsection{Mobile}
\begin{itemize}
\item Structure
\begin{itemize}
	\item Consider about the center of gravity and other equipments which on the mobile, design a stable structure and assemble it.
	\item Test which kind of structure is more suitable to the system, 2 or 3 layers.
\end{itemize}

\item Mobile
\begin{itemize}
	\item Install Ubuntu 14.04 or 16.04 and ROS on Raspberry Pi.
	\item Use SSH connect to computer.
	\item Simulate it on the Rviz.
\end{itemize}

\item SLAM
\begin{itemize}
	\item Create a 2D map by navigating autonomous car with teleoperation.
	\item Try both Gmapping SLAM and Hector SLAM on our robot and check which one is more effective.
\end{itemize}

                                  % so it should come on the page before the last. Make
                                  % sure that you do not shorten the textheight too much.
